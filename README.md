# To Do Web Application with React
This project is a web app with classical to-do list functionality where you can keep track of your daily tasks and stay productive.

The main reason for this project is to learn about React JS basics while developing a simple but nice web application, at the end it was much better than I expected because I had to learn a lot of new concepts in order to complete the app development. 

## Basic features
All of the following actions can be done with just a click and are rendered with React, that way you don't have to reload the page to see the changes reflected :)
  - Add a new task (press enter after adding the text)
  - Mark task as completed
  - Remove existing task
